# NLP-Yelp-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
The general restaurant ratings in Yelp only provide people with an overall evaluation. It does not tell any detailed stories about actual customer experience for business owners as well as consumers. If a restaurant has a rating of four stars, consumers are likely to check it out online, but they cannot determine whether it is worthwhile to visit until they skim through the review section. According to the 2018 Online Reviews Survey, Yelp has the second highest percentage of consumers that check Yelp reviews before visiting a restaurant (ReviewTrackers, 2018). For business owners, online reviews not only help build business brands and reputation but also engage with potential and existing customers, which are critical to boost their businesses. Our goal is to provide insightful suggestions for users by applying sentiment analysis to mainly four perspectives of restaurants -- food quality, service, ambience, and price. Ultimately, our models should help people better understand why customers like or dislike a restaurant and what the difference of one restaurant is from the other in terms of these categories.
