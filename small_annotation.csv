 The waitstaff is very friendly and took great care of us.They chatted with everyone who came in and made them feel at home.

6BnQwlxRn7ZuWdzninM9sQ,3,"I love chinese food and I love mexican food. What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a ""rice bowl"" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.
 
 I'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a ""C"" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room.
 
 Mmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me.
 
 The jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty.
 
 They provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special.
 
 Not gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don't recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day.",1,1,1,0

Will be going back for my next mani/pedi.

**** UPDATE*****

The great manicure that I got here lasted all the way through my vacation to Mexico without  so much as a chip! This was a regular manicure and not done with shellac.

Only now, after two days back to work and polishing mad silverware, is it starting to chip. I'm upping the stars from my former 4 to 5.

Very impressed and will be returning with friends :)",1,0,1,1

_AhOP3lL4IRMZglsd-luZQ,4,"Came in because our Toronto friends insisted on drinking some ""gator bait"" before we left to go home. This place screams New Orleans to me, and the service is friendly just like the south. We sat at the bar and drank and we were able to see them shuck oysters right in front of us, pretty cool.

lDJIaF4eYRF4F7g6Zb9euw,4,"I used to work food service and my manager at the time recommended I try Defalco's. He knows food well so I was excited to try one of his favorites spots.
 
 This place is really, really good. Lot of authentic Italian choices and they even have a grocery section with tons of legit Italian goodies. I had a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich that was to die for. Anytime my ex-manager comes back to town (he left for Vegas and I think he misses Defalco's more than anything else in the valley), he is sure to stop by and grab his favorite grub.

4PKiLkFTff9HK44QkOo6vA,4,"Heard about this place and was dying to check it put-and I'm very glad I did! Decent beer selection and kind of a hipster vibe, but $8 for a loaded hot dog and tater tots has got to be one of the best deals in town. Tons of unique toppings to pick from and delicious dipping sauces for tots (secret fry sauce was my fav). We were there early and had no problem getting a seat at the bar, but I can see how during prime time or when live music is on how it could be kind of tight. If you're going for the food is get there earlyu because that loaded dog would have been super hard to eat while standing.",1,1,0,1

3Qc49B7dA0ONmCxrn5iwCQ,2,"OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...

There are not many ""old"" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an ""Old Western Vegas"" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. 

FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? 

I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  

I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. 

A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. 

SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks. 

I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.

Service: 4 stars

Kitch: 4 stars

mbVzxuQTLRPbK-RwoGJsbA,1,"Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist, god awful, do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.

We walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  

My family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  

In the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.",1,0,1,0
enWWjMnllD4m2WTV9plfJw,5,"Excellent ramen and one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. Very small area and limited seating, so arrive early or be ready to wait. Recommend all the bowls, sake flights, and be sure to get green tea ice cream.",1,1,0,0
OED6UmN9WWtBrGCfpokffg,3,"This is a tricky one. AB is a really cool looking spot, really nice decor and ambiance, comfy booths, it even smells like a new car.
 
 My group was greeted promptly by smiling hosts, and seated in a nice booth. Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.
 
 For an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.
 
 I really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent. To be fair, we had a really difficult person that joined us, some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out, so I feel his pain.
 
 Anyway, AB is a very attractive spot that might be great for drinks and app. but for this price point, I would hit Durant's, Hillstone, or Beckett's Table. It's nice to leave a spot feeling that you got your monies worth, and that just doesn't happen here.",1,1,1,1

n4gTlCKpXBah7Ao_pv7Xpw,5,"I love this place.I admit I am stuck on the Old Fashioned Turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce.This is real fresh roast turkey (I think roasted daily but not sure) on great wheat bread, the sauce has just a bit of a bite and compliments the sandwich well.Huge helping of turkey.
 
 The setting is in an old pecan grove with mature trees, and grass.A very relaxed kind of place to just enjoy the Phoenix weather the food and those you are with.It closes during the Summer and I can't wait for it to open back up in the Fall.
 
 The perfect ending however, are the deserts.They are all hommade, and terrific.I can't get past the pecan pie, perhaps the best in Phoenix.The crust is just right flaky, and it's loaded with pecans.I'm hungry again just writing this review",1,1,0,0
V93SYj2OLh5m9Cquzf-7kg,4,Came here while in town for a country concert.  What better way to start our day.  Everything was great.  The service was amazing from the time we walked in the door.  We were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table.  You pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what you've drank.  The food we had was great.  The whiskey burger was my favorite.  For you country fans this is a must when in Scottsdale!,1,1,1,1
-ynQU4rp2A_phBaLddx64g,3,"Place was okay...
 Sangria I has was watery & unflavorful, but got me buzzed. That was part of the point of the drink, but I like a craftily concocted cocktail or elixir & this one was not.
 
 But, (I'm using a lot of buts...) the unchicken & waffles was quite okay. They used veggie meat & they did quite a good job making it like chicken. Since I can't do Roscoe's cause I'm a veggie, this spot did the trick. If Roscoe's was in Europe it would be a different story...
 
 It hit the spot. Came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side. It was all super healthy. No crazy amounts of butter or oil. Yet, it tasted amazing. But it definitely could have used a side of syrup. What was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough.
 
 The atmosphere was not to my liking. Very cafe-like and crowded.

 After my second, alcohol only, visit, I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing, add a few interesting touches, it becomes addicting.I was very happy with my sandwich.Also, they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better.

m2H0m3pDUNmkXZP4K8c_oA,2,"#1 it should be advertised as a vegetarian dinner. For the price we paid, I really would have liked a nice cut of meat.
 #2. Way over priced. Dinner for 2 with (2) blue moon beers and (1) $10 glass of wine... $165+tip. We tipped over 25% because our server was great and the experience of eating in the Dark was a pretty interesting experience.
 #3. The food was Meh... I would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding. It really wasn't... I probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different Ingredients were... It was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something. A couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? I would have been impressed a little if when I told the server that I didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others, but I didn't make a big deal because like I said before he was really nice. The dessert was literally the only saving grace.
 All in all I gave a 2 star... (server and experience in the dark)... I just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal... Be ready for a $200 vegetarian dinner!!!!

_LPOtmfWnL_8_tL3ImhoLw,5,"Not sure why some posted negative reviews of this place because it is on point. My girlfriend and I had dinner there last night, with reservations set for 6 p.m., were seated by 6:05. Our server William was awesome, was fast, attentative and really was one of the best servers we've encountered and we dine out a lot. We both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh, hot and delicious. I do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound.
 
 The only negative I did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside, May be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top. I just played a napkin over it so it was acceptable.

We spoke to the manager and the Waiter for the rest of the orders.  They said to check on our orders.  My kids got hungry and only ate fried rice that came.  Finally when the order dish came and it was very salty.  We would definitely not recommend this place if you plan to buy Groupon.  We felt we were second class.

I had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with Mexican rice, mixed cabbage coleslaw and, their own, Charro style pintos, all at the incredible price of... drum roll please... 7 Bucks! My buddy tried Paco's Taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty. Servings are huge and everything was fantastic.

R4ox2uOJsXHwRTODx0nKyg,5,"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.
 
 I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.
 
 I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. 
 
 They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.
 
 Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us. He was really funny and made sure everything came out perfectly. The bussers constantly refilled water and ensure we had everything we needed. This is an incredibly unique, delicious restaurant.",1,1,1,1

fdiNeiN_hoCxCMy2wTRW9g,4,"I'll be the first to admit that I was not excited about going to La Tavolta. Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, "" doesn't she (the chef) do an incredible job?"" She does.
 
 My hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard ""mmmm this is so good"" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn't seem to bother anyone.
 
 So-
 
 Do order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels.
 
 If they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny.
 
 Do make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don't go with a date unless you're fighting and don't feel like hearing anything they have to say.Ask to sit in the side room if it's available.",1,1,1,1

 This place was not at all what I expected from the outside. I used to come here when it was a place called M. It was totally totally different then.Anyway, it's now a very very bright and colorful Mexican cafe. 
 
 Enchiladas with Boom Boom Sauce and Mango Margaritas were good. I think I'd like to come back in summer and sit on the huge patio. Really good Tres Leches cake too.
 
 I just can't get over the interior though - I think the lighting is just SO BRIGHT, they would do themselves a favor to get a lighting scheme designer to come in and adjust things a bit - make it less of a cafeteria. It reminds me of a place in California - Chevy's... same sort of set up and theme. 
 
 Lots of families and kids. No sense of intimacy - so not a date spot for sure - a good casual place to chill after shopping at the Pottery Barn though..

QpwGPaQT-KCsfnEnEaE5qQ,5,"To whomever owns Lucki Thai:Lucki is actually spelled with a y.Sheesh, how embarrassing.Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.
 
 I've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.The large order feeds 2 perfectly.The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.
 
 I've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.
 
 Of the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.It's truly shameful.
 
 The only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.A simple misstep which I can forgive.
 
 I have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:spice consistency.I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.It actually might have gotten into the negatives.It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?
 
 But alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.Sorry I couldn't resist.",1,0,0,0

 We had a reservation for 9pm Saturday. When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet but the host asked if we wanted drinks and took our drink orders. There is no drink menu here - the staff is the drink menu- which was nice. Everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations.
 
 Our party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.
 
 The menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.
 
 For dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.
 
 Every wine pairing we tried was amazing.
 
 Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations.
 
 Expect to be here for a while. Our reservation was at 9 and we only finished eating at 11:37- and we're not slow eaters. I think the wait had to do with our party being big and the rest of the place being packed",1,1,1,0

The outside patio is quite large and there is a lot of seating available. The staff was great and very helpful with making suggestions on the menu. My favorite items on the menu are the scallops and the Apple caramel upside down cake. They were cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth.

ionasM2PY_2TFbK5Dkgg6Q,4,"Being an avid Hookah smoker with a pipe of my own I probably have a little more knowledge about Shisha and the procedures than I need, with that being known this place doesn't clean the pipes after each use and as stated with another review it really doesn't matter a whole lot what flavor you are interested in, double apple is what you will eventually end up tasting.  They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right. 

Moving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere.

The ramen was good, a little salty, but I'd recommend it. Then we received the Spider roll, which was great. Next up was the Crispy roll, which was where the problems arose. We had to wait over 45 minutes for one roll. After about half an hour they finally brought us a different roll to apologize for it taking so long. Apparently they didn't have the crispy rice prepped so that was what was taking so long. I myself am a server, and although the server came over and apologized several times, it probably would have been a good idea to have the manager come and apologize.

We got the Fajitas for 2 with Steak and Chicken, add cheese...so good, lots of flavor. Loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers, the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite.
My only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left, I smelled like I had worked the grill, my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy. I had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down. I'll just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here.
Prices were on par with other Mexican restaurants and you get more than enough to eat.
We will definitely be back and we'll be packing the Febreeze!",1,1,1,1

We had the A5 Wagyu gyoza, was tender and not overdone, Tuna tataki, Chicken Samba was a good size portion, El topo roll, chef sashimi selections, and Tonkotsu ramen. Everything we order was super yummy!  Definitely coming back again next time we're in town!!

ewmaCrLXQW7mg1Z4gAtgZg,3,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.(You are old like me if you know that theme song!)
 
 Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?That was our experience.
 
 Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.
 
 Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!
 
 Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.
 
 So if you are even a little claustrophobic,be warned, you won't be comfortable here.
 
 The food:
 
 Complimentary bruschetta:A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.
 
 Caesar salad:Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.
 
 Bread basket:Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.
 
 Spaghetti Carbonara: The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.
 
 Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.
 
 Tiramisu:No coffee flavour!I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting. Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.
 
 Lemon Sorbet:Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.
 
 Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!Ugh!
 
 TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.Not worth a second visit.
 
 2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.

l7KB334CXThAcmZPOvF1zw,2,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.
 
 First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.
 
 I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous.
 
 To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",1,1,1,1

It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.

Overpriced, and HORRIBLE service.

When a group says ""We're really thirsty. Could you please bring water while we look at the menu?"" You'd better frickin' BRING IT! 

Our waiter was pushy, rude, and S...L...O...W...
When we said that we weren't interested in hearing the specials, he read them anyway. 

He constantly tried to upsell us. Every order placed was followed by a pause, and ""Well, you know what would be really good...?"" followed by a big description of a more expensive item or an add-on.

The desperately needed water took almost twenty minutes to get to our table.

The table next to us, who was seated at least five minutes after us, received their water, drinks, and first course before we even got our water. 

Do I sound like I'm obsessing about water? In the desert, dehydration is no joke, and it's indicative of the quality (bad - very very bad) of service that we received.

_MQLmkkPKBo5ibPaidZZCQ,2,"The only reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars is because of their food and drinks. Their service however, is probably the WORST I've ever had. I used to (emphasis on the tense) go there every Tuesday for trivia night (the guy hosting is awesome). My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat.
 
 When we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was ""going to be complicated or not."" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too.
 
 I had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service.

miAbIuIln8YfLoo6rf3MyQ,3,"Visited this restaurant after a 3 hour drive to get to it.We, my boyfriend and I,saw their ad on their website for an $$85 per couple Valentine's Day Dinner.We had reservations for 6p.m. this reservation was made on Friday, we dined on Saturday. When we arrived right at 6p.m. there were plenty of OPEN tables in the restaurant.When the hostess looked for our name on the reservation list it showed we were to be sat at table 14.The list said in large print at the top..DO NOT CHANGE TABLES.The hostess walked us past 8 - 10 2 person tables to sit us at a 2 person table literally 6inches from the neighboring table!Could we have asked to sit elsewhere? Apparently not as the hostess was under direct orders not to change tables.Could we have dined elsewhere...probably not considering it is Valentines Weekend and we drove 3 hours to get there and have no reservations any where else, and no idea at 6p.m. where to go.
 
 So we sat.We could hear EVERY WORD the table next to us said. (Which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for Valentine's Day you probably shouldn't answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how ""hot"" her female coworker is.)This was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren't eavesdropping on personal info. Most uncomfortable ""romantic"" evening of my life...
 
 Now to the food.The Valentine's Day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a ""salad"", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the New Zealand Rack of Lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a Chocolate Creme Brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of Nero D'Avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). We ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.
 
 
 The soup - Lobster Bisque (Delicious) and Minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. It was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). However it did taste quite nice.
 
 The appetizer - Artichokes with Prosciutto.. YUMMO!
 
 The salad - hmm not what I had in mind. A tiny plate of Feta Cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but NOT a traditional salad..So beware!Taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...This it is not.
 
 The meal - Veal with shrimp and gnocchi..Quite pleasing to the palette.
 
 The dessert - Chocolate Creme Brulet... Umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of Chocolate Mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.Yes it did taste good, however...where was the Creme Brulet the waiter raved about?
 
 The wine - Nero D'Avola...yes I am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.But upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...Why the lie? We would have ordered the special anyway...
 
 The atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and Christmas lights through out. They had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. The place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. The managerchose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.By the time I left, my toes were frozen.
 
 We finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. I turned around and noticed FOUR empty 2 person tables. They had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple!
 
 Upon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.
 
 Would I go back when in town again? No.At the risk of being sat in that situation again.The food can be the most delicious in the world, but I still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.

 I actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.
 
 Ok onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.
 
 The portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.)
 
 I bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality.
 
 The specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead.
 
 All in all, like I said earlier, a great place for good times and smokey flavor.",1,1,0,0
w9vhFm9z4xZ5MFer1inIeg,1,The worst. Got there 45 minutes after the store was supposed to be open and they weren't ready.  Ordered a sandwich and the oven hadn't been turned on.  I asked how long and the employee said a few minutes. 8 minutes later oven still not preheated and I let her know I had to go.  She then pulls the sandwich out of the oven.  Cleary the sandwich would not have been prepared correctly.  I did not take sandwich and had to leave to get to an appointment. My  quick stop for a coffee and breakfast to go was over 15 minutes.  When I sent in a complaint to the head office the slow response was they couldn't give me a credit but would send over coupons for a couple of beverages.  That is ridiculous.  I wanted a refund on the sandwich I never took. I pass by this second cup 5 days a week. I'm going to keep on driving and stick with Starbucks. You should also steer clear. Best example of the worst service.,1,0,1,0
NRUHiXvHs1x-mFAOetG17Q,3,"Good prices here, huge pancakes available.The place is a bit ""breakfast diner""ish, which is fine since it is a breakfast diner.My only probelm is that our server seemed a little impatient.The service was fine, but could use a little more friendliness.
 
 Anyways, this place is nothing special.But if you're in the area, try it out and you'll get exactly what you expect when you're walking in.No big surprises here.

LE2QcPq6NRwC85utjUmdAg,4,"Without a doubt,  my favorite Indian restaurant to date. There is a lot of variety, but my favorite dish is the chicken korma. The butter chicken is also fantastic. It is deliciously sweet and kid-friendly because it is not too spicy. For those of you who like to feel the burn, they have plenty of options to choose from, as well. I recommend the Thali for people who are just starting to explore their Asian culinary senses. Also, if you are a naan connoisseur, you need add Palais d'Ajit to your list.

Don't expect any fancy surroundings. It looks like a hole in the wall but you'll be convinced to enter the door when you get a whiff of the food (which can be detected from a block away). The staff are very friendly although sometimes the service is slow. If you don't like to wait, call ahead and take it home!",1,1,1,0
gCLbUG4PnhwhBKR_5jARjw,2,"Having dined at many other Vegas buffets (the Wynn, the Paris, the Mirage, etc.) I found myself very underwhelmed. Everyone raves about the Bellagio buffet but I just kept wishing I had gone to the Wynn.
 The decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.

Enchiladas during the morning on weekends are the best as well, delicious! And if you really want to try real huevos rancheros try them here!!!!! There are some other places in the neighbourhood to claim to offer them and trust me none of the are authentic as they are here. Always a great experience, keep the good work!

I'm already planning the next time I come here. And my server was a sweet sweet girl. Soft spoken but just the perfect server. I'd take a picture of my food but I dove in and cleaned my plate. Lol.

f0B9-r14-bLudyu5S7aLhw,1,We had dinner at the Bellagio Buffet last night. The service was OK. Our server was great but kind of forgot about us towards the end of our visit. The food was cold. The only good thing there was the crab legs because they're suppose to be cold and the tacos because it was freshly made. The food was under a single lamp that didn't heat the food at all. We let the server know that the food was cold and he told the manager that was in charge. All she did was come over to ask what the problem was and said she was going to talk to the chief. Have no idea what actually happened though because we didn't see her after that. Half the buffet was closed as well so there wasn't that many options. I must say i rather go to the Rio buffet.

JVcjMhlavKKn3UIt9p9OXA,1,"I cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years. I picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick.I was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter).Today, my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don't serve the duck & coleslaw side. We waited about 10 minutes to get our menu.After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.I could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow.The worst part of it was that the service.The servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order).We had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow, this couple received their pho before mine.They were almost done eating their pho before mine came out.",1,0,1,0

Nakama is good for some enjoyable sushi and, more importantly, the atmosphere.You can go here and watch the pens game AND eat a roll.Can't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants.

I love going to Seventh Street market, sitting Not Just Coffee and having a drink while waiting for delicious fresh made pizza from Pure.I've taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market, and I can say that the pizza doesn't do well reheated. So try to eat it fresh while there if possible.
 
 If one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you, go for it, as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money.I wanted what I wanted, though, so I ended up with a medium, thin crust, regular crust pizza with jalapenos, pepperoncini, onions and feta.It was pretty expensive at $2/topping = $20 med pizza.

My Sonoran dog looked like it was from the previous day... typical dry wrinkled no snap day-old dog, the brioche bun was soggy from too much butter. And the tacos were cold.

Everything is what you'd expect from a $10-$15 breakfast, and that's why I gave it 4-stars.

The waitresses are really nice and friendly, which is the kick start of a good morning.

Our family enjoys a good cut that's perfectly done to each person's speculations. Also the service was perfect. Our server was thoughtful and attentive, without overly interrupting when we didn't need anything. However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return. If I'm paying this much, I'd like to feel a little more pampered.",1,1,1,1

I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably.

 The experience.The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.The potato salad that accompanied it was good.
 The flat bread was not good.There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated, but also expected as it was not edible.

We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated and when we got to our table it was against the wall, half booth half chairs. My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said ""No"" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced.
 The worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in.

I wasn't sure the first time we went if we should dress up or if it was okay to wear jeans and a nice top but everyone was either in their business casual work clothes or jeans. I would recommend getting there a little early because it fills up quickly! We got there at 6pm and by 7pm it was pretty full.I have recommended this to so many of my co-workers and friends to try out and so far anyone that has gone has come back to me saying what a great time they had and how surprised they were with the 5 for 6 'til 7 deal :),0,1,1,1

6QMO2v4zi8nKyuzV_o_3pw,5,"This restaurant is a real local secret. Open since 1965, the original owner and chef was still cooking in the kitchen on a Monday night at 10:00 when most restaurants were closed. So happy I found it. Amazing food, wonderful authentic Italian atmosphere and friendly, and well-timed  service in English, French or Italian!",1,1,1,0

29S2A-Q8Vt4a-Z6St1dcWw,4,"Wonderful experience. We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did. If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!",1,1,1,0
jdDxglqBqPJPYQO5QlY8pA,5,"Hands down best Bloody Mary ever. So many things in my BM, veggiesmmm bacon.""Nailed it"" it's an appetizer. I also had the burger with fries. Who knew fries could be so good. The presentation doesn't disappoint ether. Very nice. Great seating outside although we sat inside. Would love to see this restaurant near my hometown. Seriously. Get the BM. You rock Guy!",1,1,0,0
P4dPuD9Idbywu4431_-dMQ,4,"Cafe Maya, the newest coffee shop in this location. Not too much has changed, although the inside seems a bit more spacious and cozy. They offer all of your typical coffee drinks and prices are reasonable. They have a couch and a large chair as well as around 10 wooden tables with chairs. They offer a food menu for breakfast and lunch, but not dinner. They also have a rewards punch card for loyal customers. This place is usually pretty quiet and chill and not too busy, so a good place to go for some casual studying. There is no parking lot, so you have to hope to find a street parking spot available nearby which is the main limitation if you are driving. Overall a nice little coffee shop.",1,1,0,1
1wVA2-vQIuW_ClmXkDxqMQ,4,Great lunch today. Staff was very helpful in assisting with selections and knowledgeable on the ingredients. We enjoyed the BBQ chicken with tika masala sauce and really good naan bread. The biryani with chicken was also yummy! Fun to see the food being prepared in the tandoori ovens. Great addition to the fast casual scene in Cleveland.,1,1,1,0
iNjbcPUqa1v_VjMysmZGjg,4,"The food is great we did a rib eye & a sirloin pretty basic cuts, both were done correctly. The mushroom ravioli appetizer is special, the tuna as well...The decor is nice and makes this place a nice one for 'special' dinners. As others have mentioned it is pricey with a good tip for good service we were at $185 for two appetizers, two sides, two steaks and one glass of wine... hummm....",1,1,0,1

IQ6yUAb-sCu4iQ5MMjDCHA,5,Wild every night! My favorite place hands-down in AZ! The night life here is contagious and Iv never been disappointed with there Sunday fun day! Every Sunday they have a corn hole competition and crazy drink specials like penny refills!! You also have to try there duck and pork tacos or there Hefe Hamburger! My favorite margarita on the menu is the la chica flaca. If you want a fun place to get lunch and a few drinks or looking to go crazy night this is the spot.,1,0,0,0

W6VRRz7mVGZLsidyHelHwg,5,"This place is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.
 
 My favorites are the Chicken Scarpariello, the pizza and the Sangria. My wife can't decide between four dishes. Our daughter loves the Penne ala Vodka, Lasagna, or Ravioli.
 
 Mario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here. I've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks.
 
 Plus to top it off, when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues, Mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults. All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons.
 
 Get the idea? It's all good at this neighborhood gem!",1,0,1,1
H7_GBToDD0YX8TAu-zRTsA,5,"My first time visiting Sabor today and all I can say is what an absolute spectacular culinary experience! Their Latin Street food was fresh and very, very tasty. The Empanadas were perfectly cooked and juicy, not dry at all. The street corn, which is a favorite of mine, was the best I have had so far. I can highly recommend their shrimp and steak tacos which were soft and had great flavor. We ordered sliced avocado, creamy cold quacamole and together with the rosa sauce and fresh lime on the side made for a meal levels above what we paid for or expected. I love that you have so many choices to choose from to make up a meal that will satisfy any food cravings or preferences you might have and it is fresh and clean. On top of this the staff is friendly and very helpful. Such a joy! My kids loved this perfect little addition to Davidson as well and I can definitely see us becoming regulars.",1,0,1,0

E4LqIZ7DJd_R4ZHSNKx4RQ,4,"So good! They didn't make it to 5 stars due to the prices are a bit high for the amount of food and the location is a bit unsavory.
 The decor and atmosphere was surprisingly nice, from the outside I expected to be more run down inside. The staff was very nice. We were surprised how empty the dining room was for a Friday evening.
 We got Vegetable Samosas to start then ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, rice and plain Naan. Our only complaint was the lamb could've been more tender but everything was flavorful and delicious.
 I would definitely go again if given the chance.",1,1,1,1
ky-0-ENo6cDrdQlJvcOtsQ,4,"I have been to ChuChai 5 times now. Trust me on this, get the sticky rice and the crispy duck! I would have given them 5 stars but the last time I was there, the food arrived cold and we asked them to reheat it. It came back to the table just as cold the second time.
 
 The patio is a great people-watching spot in the summer plus it's bring your own wine which helps keep the cost down seeing as it is a tad overpriced.",1,0,1,1
0AsmPiAQduxh5jE_si8cLA,5,"ended up here because Raku was closed and it received great ratings on Yelp.I'm so glad I came here.One of the better meals I've had.Started off with the mushroom dish and the lettuce wrap.both were amazing. the lettuce wrap is like having a flavor party in your mouth.also had the panang duck which was terrific. highly recommend all three dishes. one dish that wasn't so good was the seabass with drunken noodles. overall it was an excellent meal, intimate setting, and great service. definitely will be back.",1,1,1,0
4bUyL7lzoWzDZaJETAKREg,3,"Good selection of classes of beers and mains. I've been here twice.
 
 First time I had the fried chicken. It was delicious, but be warned, extremely salty. I couldn't even finish the last piece of chicken after experiencing a salt overload.
 
 Second time we came on a wednesday. We didn't know it was BBQ night, where they have a completely different menu, and don't offer anything from their original vegetarian-friendly menu. This menu has one vegetarian-friendly option - an eggplant sandwich. The vegetarian in my party said it was awful. Also, on BBQ night you choose 2 sides. Except they were out of all their sides except 2 - fries and potato salad. I can't say I was thrilled to have carb heavy sides with my carb heavy main. How do you run out of sides so early in the evening?
 
 Service not so great.
 
 I'd avoid coming here on wednesdays.",1,0,1,0

That being said rubios is so relative because everyday I go to rubios for lunch they make me feel at home and like a valued customer by showing quality service and going over and beyond the standard for me! They don't sale chimichangas but the manager George and the great cooks took it upon themselves to fry my burrito for me! George is a great leader and represents that franchise at a high level! Last but not least Priscilla the shift leader, lights up the whole room with her smile as soon as you are opening the door, as well delivering excellent service!

wOv7JiO0EGcJ61P2JcDS1g,2,"Went here last weekend and was pretty disappointed. They did not have one thing that was pictured and recommended on yelp as being good. We started off with the steak grilled skewers which were just Ok, nothing special. My freind got the lasagna and I got some special chicken dish. They were both pretty bland and lacking that kick. Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked. With such a big name attached to this restaurant and going on such an empty stomach we had such high hopes. The service was great which is why i gave it three stars.",1,0,1,0
fsXTNmi-cHlDQHzJ4GHg7w,1,"Wish I could give this place 0 stars. We have had issues here before with being seated (it took them 15 minutes when the place was empty one time), but tonight takes the cake. 
 We went to get food at 2am, pulled into the drive thru at 2:32. We waited there for 15 minutes, then we got trapped in the drive thru by a curb and other vehicles for 25 more minutes. I got incredibly fed up and walked inside. There were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating. One woman was ordering at the counter when I went in. 
 I asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave. All he said is ""I don't know if they shut down the drive thru but I can take your order here."" Like THAT DOESNT HELP US. We are STILL stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don't even want to order here anymore. He said he would meet me outside - which he DIDNT by the way, but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes.
 After they got the person in front of us through the drive thru, they then told US to hold on a minutes because they are ""backed up inside"", but they weren't at all. The parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line, and when I was inside, a server was sitting at a table texting. So don't tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing. I yelled ""are you getting paid for this?"" Through the speaker and he had time to answer and tell me to CALM DOWN but couldn't take my damn order.
 We finally left with out even PLACING an order after 49 minutes. Will not return and by the other reviews for this place, I should have checked yelp before ever coming here in the first place. Went to the Mentor one after and got served right away.",0,0,1,0
